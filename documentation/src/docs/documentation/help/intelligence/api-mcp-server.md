# API / MCP Server

Since version `30.6.1606`, WebSSH introduces a built-in **API / MCP (Model Context Protocol) server**, enabling external applications to interact with WebSSH programmatically.

This opens up a range of possibilities for integration—including with AI applications such as Claude Desktop. By using the API, these tools can automate tasks, retrieve data, or incorporate WebSSH’s capabilities into more complex workflows.

This feature is only available on macOS.

## Example Use Cases

- **AI Applications (e.g., Claude Desktop):**  
  Automate SSH sessions, manage terminals, or extract data for analysis within the app.

- **Custom Integrations:**  
  Connect your own scripts or automation tools directly to WebSSH’s functionality.

- **Data Retrieval and Management:**  
  Programmatically fetch server status, logs, or outputs for use in dashboards or other applications.
