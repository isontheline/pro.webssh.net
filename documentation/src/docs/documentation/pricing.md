??? abstract "Why upgrading to PRO?"
    :two_hearts: Help me continue WebSSH development by upgrading to **PRO** version : I'm an indie developer who want to make an awesome tool for you!

    :thumbsup: Every day I enhance WebSSH as your feedbacks are coming. I'm always listening to your needs and I'm trying to implement them as soon as possible.

    :arrow_right: By purchasing WebSSH **PRO** you can add as many SSH / SFTP / TUNNEL connections as you want.

    :one: Only one purchase will allow you to use WebSSH **PRO** on all your devices (by using the same Apple ID). So you will be able to use WebSSH **PRO** on your iPhone, your iPad and your Mac with the same purchase!

    :moneybag: Get your money's worth : Unlike competitors, WebSSH **PRO** isn't a subscription model app. No hidden costs. You buy it for **lifetime** with regular updates for **FREE**!

??? tip "Student and educator discounts"
    Students and educators are the backbone of our tech community. Whether you're learning system administration, teaching others, or managing school infrastructure, I want to make sure WebSSH **PRO** is accessible to you.
    
    [Contact me](/documentation/contact-me/) for details and your discount redemption link.

??? danger "It's too expensive!"
    Since 2012, WebSSH has been sustained and maintained as an indie app supported by a one-time purchase, with regular monthly updates provided for **FREE** — and I want to keep it that way. Unlike competitors, there's no subscription model or hidden costs.

    If you think the price is too high, please consider the effort I put into making WebSSH an awesome sysadmin tool for you. The price supports ongoing development and maintenance of the app.

    If you still can't afford it, you can continue using the **FREE** version, which is already very generous compared to competitors, or contact me to discuss a promotional code :)

Yes you see it right : **FREE** version is the most generous free tier you can find on the App Store for SSH / SFTP / TELNET / Serial Port clients! You can do the same as the **PRO** version but with only one connection saved at a time.

If you need more information about the differences between **FREE** and **PRO** versions, please [contact me](/documentation/contact-me/), [open a discussion](https://github.com/isontheline/pro.webssh.net/discussions/new/choose) on GitHub or just ask <a href="#" onclick="javascript:showDocumentationAssistant(); return false;">WebSSH Brain - Documentation Assistant</a>.
