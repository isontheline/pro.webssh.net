# Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which WebSSH collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the WebSSH app ("App") and the WebSSH website ("Website").

## Introduction 
**Your privacy is our top priority.** We have developed this Privacy Policy to transparently describe our practices regarding personal information and data collection from users of our App and Website.

### Our Privacy Commitment:

* **No personal information collection** – We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information
* **No analytics or tracking** – We do not collect any usage statistics, behavioral data, or analytics
* **Complete privacy** – We have zero access to your SSH connections, credentials, or server data when you use WebSSH

### In Summary
We maintain a strict zero-data collection policy. Your WebSSH usage remains entirely private and is never collected, stored, or shared – **guaranteed**.

## Cookies
We don't use tracking cookies on the Website.

## WebSSH Brain
WebSSH Brain is a generative AI assistant that helps you craft SSH commands, snippets, and scripts. It can also answer questions about the WebSSH documentation website.

### AI Tools Rely on Third-Party AI Services
WebSSH Brain utilizes Third-Party AI Services through OpenRouter's gateway to provide AI-powered assistance. AI models are chosen dynamically based on performance, privacy and relevance to your queries. OpenRouter acts as an intermediary and has its own privacy practices, which you can review at [openrouter.ai/privacy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy).

**Third-Party AI Services do not have continuous access to your data.** When you use WebSSH Brain to generate commands, analyze scripts, or answer questions, necessary data such as your prompts, queries, and conversation context are shared with Third-Party AI Services for that specific interaction only.

**Post the initial interaction**, Third-Party AI Services do not retain access to any updates, responses, or results related to the shared content. All data is managed and deleted in accordance with Third-Party AI Services data retention policies, ensuring your privacy and security.

### AI Models Used
WebSSH Brain may utilize various AI models including but not limited to models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and others, selected dynamically based on your query needs.

### What WebSSH Brain Does NOT Collect:
* **No device data** – We do not collect any information from your device
* **No configuration data** – Your SSH settings, server configurations and other data remain private
* **No training on your data** – Your conversations are **never used to train or improve AI models**. Any data shared will not be used for AI model training or improvement
* **Query processing only** – Your data is used exclusively to provide responses to your queries

### Data Sharing and Privacy Controls:
* **Data is only sent to Third-Party AI Services when WebSSH Brain is actively used** – No data is transmitted unless you explicitly interact with the AI assistant
* **You control when data is shared** – Simply disable WebSSH Brain in App settings if you prefer not to share any data with third-party AI services

### Chat History Storage:
The only data temporarily retained in volatile memory is your **conversation history** with WebSSH Brain, which is necessary to:

* Maintain context within your chat session
* Provide relevant follow-up responses

**Data retention:** Chat history is automatically deleted **one (1) hour after your Brain session ends**. This ensures your conversations are only stored for the minimum time necessary to provide functionality.

Data is processed through OpenRouter's gateway and handled according to both OpenRouter's and the underlying AI provider's data retention policies.

### Important Disclaimer:
**Exercise caution when using AI-generated commands.** Never execute commands without fully understanding their implications. The developer cannot assume responsibility for any damage to systems or data. **You, as the user, are solely responsible for actions taken while using WebSSH Brain.**

You can disable WebSSH Brain at any time in the App settings.
