# Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which WebSSH collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a "User") of the WebSSH app ("App") and the WebSSH website ("Website").

## Introduction 
**Your privacy is our top priority.** We have developed this Privacy Policy to transparently describe our practices regarding personal information and data collection from users of our App and Website.

### Our Privacy Commitment:

* **No personal information collection** – We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information
* **No analytics or tracking** – We do not collect any usage statistics, behavioral data, or analytics
* **Complete privacy** – We have zero access to your SSH connections, credentials, or server data when you use WebSSH

### In Summary
We maintain a strict zero-data collection policy. Your WebSSH usage remains entirely private and is never collected, stored, or shared – **guaranteed**.

## Cookies
We don't use tracking cookies on the Website.

## WebSSH Brain
WebSSH Brain is a generative AI assistant that helps you craft SSH commands, snippets, and scripts. It can also answer questions about the WebSSH documentation website.

### What WebSSH Brain Does NOT Collect:
* **No device data** – We do not collect any information from your device
* **No configuration data** – Your SSH settings, server configurations and ALL other data remain private
* **No training on your data** – Your conversations are never used to train AI models
* **Query processing only** – Your data is used exclusively to provide responses to your queries

### Chat History Storage:
The only data temporarily retained in volatile memory is your **conversation history** with WebSSH Brain, which is necessary to:

* Maintain context within your chat session
* Provide relevant follow-up responses

**Data retention:** Chat history is automatically deleted **one (1) hour after your Brain session ends**. This ensures your conversations are only stored for the minimum time necessary to provide functionality.

### Important Disclaimer:
**Exercise caution when using AI-generated commands.** Never execute commands without fully understanding their implications. The developer cannot assume responsibility for any damage to systems or data. **You, as the user, are solely responsible for actions taken while using WebSSH Brain.**
